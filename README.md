# ![Vimflowy](/public/images/vimflowy-32.png?raw=true) Vimflowy

This is a productivity tool which draws great inspiration from workflowy and vim.

[Try it out online] (https://vimflowy.bitballoon.com), or [download it as a local app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimflowy/dkdhbejgjplkmbiglmjobppakgmiimei)!

(Video coming eventually...)

## NOTES ##

- Vimflowy is currently aimed at vim users, who should feel at home.
The plan is to eventually have very customizable bindings, and defaults for normal people (as well as emacs users).
But for now, if you want to use vimflowy, you should first [learn vim](http://vim-adventures.com/)
- The app is entirely local. The online version uses localStorage, so it should be used in only one browser
- Currently, weird things happen when you use it in multiple tabs
- There are many [known inconsistencies with vim](vim_inconsistencies.md), mostly intentional.

## FEATURES ##

- Workflowy features
  - bullets, sub-bullets
  - collapsing
  - zooming
