# vimflowy

This is a productivity tool which draws great inspiration from workflowy and vim

Try it out [here](https://vimflowy.bitballoon.com)!

(Video coming eventually...)

## FEATURES ##

- Workflowy features
  - bullets, sub-bullets
  - collapsing
  - zooming

  - keybindings for everything
  - Undo!  Full history kept within a session
  - Macros

## NOTES ##

- The app is entirely local - the storage is localStorage, so it should be used in only one browser
- Currently, weird things happen when you use it in multiple tabs
- There are many [known inconsistencies with vim](vim_inconsistencies.md), mostly intentional.
