# ![Vimflowy](/assets/images/vimflowy-32.png?raw=true) Vimflowy

This is a productivity tool which draws great inspiration from workflowy and vim.

Try it out!
- [online] (https://vimflowy.bitballoon.com)
- [chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimflowy/dkdhbejgjplkmbiglmjobppakgmiimei): This version will be sparsely updated
- [dev setup](CONTRIBUTING.md)

(Video coming eventually...)

## NOTES ##

- The app is entirely local. The online version uses localStorage, so it should be used in only one browser.
  If you're going to have a large document, use a browser with large localStorage limits
- Currently, weird things happen when you use multiple tabs simultaneously
- Tested mostly in Chrome and Firefox
- There are [known inconsistencies with vim](vim_inconsistencies.md)
